            <p>How is my fare calculated?</p>
            <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>The final fare is calculated on the basis of the total fare for a trip.

                To calculate fare for a flat fare discount package:
                
                If the total fare is ever less than the flat fare, we'll charge you the minimum of the two amounts. If the total fare is greater than the flat fare but less than the max fare cap, you will be charged only the flat fare amount.
                
                If the fare of the trip is over the max fare cap, then you will still save, but the amount over the max fare cap will be added to the flat fare amount.
                
                To calculate fare for a percentage discount package:
                
                The fare will be calculated based on percentage discount mentioned on your package upto the max discount cap.
                
                Please note that the wait time charges will be over and above the final fare.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p>Can I get a refund?</p>
            <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Currently, refunds are not available on Loyalty Packages. Once you purchase your Loyalty Package, it will be valid for up to 1 month.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p>I want to review the price for a trip</p>
            <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Before confirming your trip, you'll see either an upfront price or an estimated range.

                If you feel your trip price was too high, please let us know within 30 days of the trip.
                
                Select the trip you want us to review, and then select Next.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p>I changed my destination</p>
            <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>When you request a ride, you are shown an upfront fare, which is our estimate for how much the trip should cost, based on the estimated distance, time and tolls, and it holds as long as destination remains unchanged and the GPS suggested route is followed.

                Please note that if you get dropped off at a destination other than what you requested, or if you entered a destination that was not marked correctly on the map, your fare will change to a fare based on the actual distance, time and tolls for the trip.
                
                We recommend that you enter the exact destination in the app to prevent confusion on the amount you need to pay.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p>I was charged more than my Rental package</p>
            <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Rental trips allow you to rent an Uber for multiple hours, according to the package chosen by you. Tolls are not included in the package fare shown for the trip because, for a rental trip, you can place the request for a ride without enering all the destinations and hence, an estimate cannot be made about the tolls that might be charged, prior to trip completion.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <p>Forgot something in an Uber? We will help you find it!</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>We encourage riders to make a habit of ensuring they have all their belongings with them before hopping out of an Uber. However, we understand that sometimes items are left behind accidentally, so weâ€™re here to help you track down an item you may have left in a car.

       <div class="question">
        <p>More than 4 passengers rode together</p>
        <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>We understand that picking up a larger group of riders can present additional challenges.

            At Uber, we are committed to the safety of everyone using the Uber platform -- riders and drivers. To that end, do not allow more passengers than your vehicle has seat belts for. Politely decline a trip if more than the maximum amount of people are attempting to enter your vehicle. When this happens, it's good practice to suggest the group request an additional vehicle.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>My toll or parking fee wasn't included in my fare</p>
        <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Usually, when your vehicle passes through a toll during a ride, the toll amount is automatically added to the rider fare. You pay the toll upfront and then get it reimbursed from us.

            NOTE: If the toll amount through e-pass cost less than the toll amount through cash, you will be refunded the lower amount</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Driver fare review policy</p>
        <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>If you feel that your fare is incorrect, Uber will review the trip details to check if it is eligible for an adjustment. All requests for fare reviews must be made within 10 days of the trip.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>How earnings are calculated</p>
        <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>We calculate your earnings & process the total payout to you by adding the following components:

            Earned trip fares
            Cancellation fees if any
            Incentives if applicable
            Referral rewards if any
            Additionally, the following deductions are made before processing the payouts:
            
            Uber fees
            Cash collected from riders
            Device subscription fees if applicable
            Vehicle leasing fees if applicable
            Any other deductions as applicable</p>

    <div class="question">
        <p>How tips work</p>
        <i class="arrow fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Uber does not ask or expect riders to tip. In most cities, when you arrive at a rider's destination and end the trip, the fare is automatically charged to the rider's account. Tips and gratuities are not included in trip fares.

            Any cash gratuity offered by a rider is voluntary. If a rider wishes to tip you, please feel free to accept.</p>
